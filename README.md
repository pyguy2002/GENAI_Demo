# GENAI_Demo

A chatbot that will answer employee questions regarding different department policies. The classification component offers the employee the option to raise a ticket if the answer to their question is not available or not sufficient/clear enough, where hopefully a person will provide the answer or clarification.

The app has three "tabs", one tab is for the user to interact with the chatbot and sumbit a ticket if necessary. The second tab is for the administrator to upload training data for the classification componenent of the app. Lastly, the third tab is where the administrator will upload the pdfs containing the department policies.
